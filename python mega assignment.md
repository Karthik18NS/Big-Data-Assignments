Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ans: Variables are the basic unit of storage in a programming language. These variables consist of a data type, the variable name, and the value to be assigned to the variable. Unless and until the variables are declared and initialized, they cannot be used in the program.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
ans:  Python input() function is used to take user input. By default, it returns the user input in form of a string.



Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ans: the input() function by default returns the value as string data typeâ€‹.


Q8. What is type casting?
ans: Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
ans: Using split() method : 
This function helps in getting multiple inputs from users. It breaks the given input by the specified separator. If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator. Generally, users use a split() method to split a Python string but one can use it in taking multiple inputs.


Q10. What are keywords?
ans: Keywords in Python are unique reserved words that cannot use a keyword as a variable, function, or other identifiers.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason?
ans: no ,Suppose True keyword in python. If you use this keyword as variable, then compiler will get confused whether it is a variable or keyword.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
ans: Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
ans: The basic way to do output is the print statement. To end the printed line with a newline, add a print statement without any objects. This will print to any object that implements write(), which includes file objects.


Q14. What are operators in Python?
ans: In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands. Here is an example: >>> >>> a = 10 >>> b = 20 >>> a + b 30.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
ans: Both / and % are two different operators used in Python. These operators are mathematical operators and both have different uses.
/ Only perform the division operation in mathematics and returns results as the quotient.
While % is known as modulus.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```?
ans: 1,0,false,1



Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
ans: The if statement is a conditional statement in python, that is used to determine whether a block of code will be executed or not. Meaning if the program finds the condition defined in the if statement to be true, it will go ahead and execute the code block inside the if statement.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
ans: If Elif Else Statements
The if/elif/else structure is a common way to control the flow of a program, allowing you to execute specific blocks of code depending on the value of some data
if statement
If the condition following the keyword if evaluates as true, the block of code will execute. Note that parentheses are not used before and after the condition check as in other languages.
else statement
You can optionally add an else response that will execute if the condition
elif statement
Multiple conditions can be checked by including one or more elif checks after your initial if statement. Just keep in mind that only one condition will execute.


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote"?
ans: a=int(input("enter the age "))

Q34. What is a list in Python?
ans:A list is an ordered data structure with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets.

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
ans:To create a list in Python, we use square brackets ( [] ). Here's what a list looks like: ListName = [ListItem, ListItem1, ListItem2, ListItem3, ...]


Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
ans:To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.

     print(my_list)


Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.?
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
ans:lst.insert(3,'Big')
    lst


Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
ans:The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple.The contents of a tuple cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples. 


Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
ans:A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses () , separated by commas. The parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice to use them. A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string, etc.).


Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.?
ans:no,Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.


Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
ans:No,Tuple is immutable, although you can use the + operator to concatenate several tuples. The old object is still present at this point, and a new object is created.


Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it?
ans:my_tuple = tuple(input('Enter space-separated words: ').split())
    print(len(my_tuple))
    print(my_tuple)


Q45. What are sets in Python?
ans:The sets are an unordered collection of data types. These are mutable, iterable, and do not consist of any duplicate elements.


Q46. How can you create a set?
ans:You can create an empty set in python by using the set() function. One can think an empty set can be created using the curly braces {}, but notice that python interprets empty curly braces as a dictionary. 


Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set?
ans:thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
    thisset.add("iNeuron")
    print(thisset)
    type(thisset)


Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function?
ans: tset.add() takes exactly one argument 


Q49. How is update() different from add()?
ans:We use add() method to add single value to a set. We use update() method to add sequence values to a set. Here Sequences are any iterables including list , tuple , string , dict etc.


Q50. What is clear() in sets?
ans:The clear() method removes all elements in a set.


Q51. What is frozen set?
ans:Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation. Due to this, frozen sets can be used as keys in Dictionary or as elements of another set.


Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
ans:A set is a mutable object while frozenset provides an immutable implementation. Additionally, the collections library includes the Counter object which is an implementation of a multiset, it stores both the unique items and a count as to how many times it has been added to the container.


Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code?
ans:The union() method returns a new set with elements from the set and all other sets (passed as an argument).
If the argument is not passed to union(), it returns a shallow copy of the set.
A = {'a', 'c', 'd'}
B = {'c', 'd', 2 }
C = {1, 2, 3}

print('A U B =', A.union(B))
print('B U C =', B.union(C))
print('A U B U C =', A.union(B, C))


Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code?
ans:intersection() method returns the intersection of set A with all the sets (passed as argument).

If the argument is not passed to intersection(), it returns a shallow copy of the set (A).
A = {2, 3, 5, 4}
B = {2, 5, 100}
C = {2, 3, 8, 9, 10}

print(B.intersection(A))
print(B.intersection(C))
print(A.intersection(C))


Q55. What is dictionary in Python?
ans:Dictionaries are Python's implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.


Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures?

          2: {'Name': 'Marie', 'Age': '22', 'Sex': 'Female'}}

for p_id, p_info in people.items():
    print("\nPerson ID:", p_id)
    
    for key in p_info:
        print(key + ':', p_info[key])


Q62. What is the use of get() function?
ans:The get() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.


Q63. What is the use of items() function?
ans:The items() method returns a view object. The view object contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list. The view object will reflect any changes done to the dictionary


Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
ans:Python list pop() is an inbuilt function in Python that removes and returns the last value from the List or the given index value.


Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?
ans:The popitem() method removes the item that was last inserted into the dictionary.The popitem() method removes a random item. The removed item is the return value of the popitem() method, as a tuple, see example below.


Q66. What is the use of keys() function?
ans:The keys() method returns a view object. The view object contains the keys of the dictionary, as a list.


Q67. What is the use of values() function?
ans:The values() method returns a view object. The view object contains the values of the dictionary, as a list. The view object will reflect any changes done to the dictionary


Q68. What are loops in Python?
ans:Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.


Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
ans:The three types of loops in Python programming are while loop, for loop, and nested loops.


Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
ans:The for and while loops are both conditional statements. A for loop is a single-line command that will be executed repeatedly. While loops can be single-lined or contain multiple commands for a single condition.


Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
ans:The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration. 


Q72. What is the use of break statement?
ans:The break statement is frequently used to terminate the processing of a particular case within a switch statement.


Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
ans: The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.


Q74. What is the use of range() function?
ans:The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.


Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
ans:You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop. When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.
